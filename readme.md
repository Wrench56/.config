# My .config files

Here are all of my .config files. I use this directory for my Ubuntu AND Windows, thus you will find configs like ``scoop`` even when installed on Linux. This shouldn't cause any problems, but I plan creating (in the far future) releases for Ubuntu and Windows under tags.

## .setup folder

This folder contains bash scripts to setup and install requirements for the tools I use. Some examples are: latest ``neovim`` and ``neovim plugin requirements``, ``cargo``, ``node``

### fix_wsl.sh

This is a simple script trying to fix ``WSL 1`` errors. One of the things that might brake is invalid executable format.
